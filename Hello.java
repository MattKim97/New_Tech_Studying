/*we will use a IDE to compile our stuff

What is the JRE?
the runtime environment has access to all of the compiled code of Java 
if our application is running somewhere else, like another machine, that machine needs to at least have a runtime environment on it to run the compiled code.

IDEIntegrated development environment
sort of where the JDK and the JRE meets
brings everything together
can write in text, but why would you. need to write and compile and run it in 3 different steps
rather than IDE doing it all for us a one step shop aas well as syntax highlighting
can format our code for us as well, indentation, more reader spell check etc
can do shorthands in IDE as well

Intellisense
when writing code, our editor, will try to guess what we are going to do next, will give us a list of those things
such as variables, etc etc.
can create an instance of a class and then hover over the variable, we will get the documentation of what that instance is
 */

public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello Hello !");
    }

}

/*
 class{
    function{

    }
 }

 usually want a main class and a main function

 each function is a block of code
 a function within a class is a method
    a method is a function that belongs to a class
    a class is a blueprint for an object
    an object is an instance of a class
    a class can have many methods
    a method can have many functions
    a function can have many lines of code

want to start each function with what it returns
such as void, int, string, etc
void means it does not return anything
int means it returns an integer
string means it returns a string

public means it can be accessed from anywhere

static means it belongs to the class, not an instance of the class
    can be called without creating an instance of the class
    can be called from the class itself
    can be called from the instance of the class

main is the entry point of the program
    the program will start at the main function
    the main function is the first function that will be called
    the main function is the first function that will be executed
    the main function is the first function that will be run
