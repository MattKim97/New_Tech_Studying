/*we will use a IDE to compile our stuff

What is the JRE?
the runtime environment has access to all of the compiled code of Java 
if our application is running somewhere else, like another machine, that machine needs to at least have a runtime environment on it to run the compiled code.

IDEIntegrated development environment
sort of where the JDK and the JRE meets
brings everything together
can write in text, but why would you. need to write and compile and run it in 3 different steps
rather than IDE doing it all for us a one step shop aas well as syntax highlighting
can format our code for us as well, indentation, more reader spell check etc
can do shorthands in IDE as well

Intellisense
when writing code, our editor, will try to guess what we are going to do next, will give us a list of those things
such as variables, etc etc.
can create an instance of a class and then hover over the variable, we will get the documentation of what that instance is
