// super set of javascript, allows us to provide extra features on top of javascript, developed by microsoft
// validates your code is working correctly, writing types is optional
// typescript is also a compiler "complies it into javascript"    


//Types in javascript

function addNumbers ( a,b) {
    return a + b
}

console.log(addNumbers("5","6"))

//gives 56 instead of 11 like we would rather have
// typescript tells us that we should only put integers instead of a string, instead of having to type out pseudocode
